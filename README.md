# React Less Boilerplate

- I always dislike all of the boilerplate testing and files that React adds to my project when I use cra, so I made this CLI to create me a project with none of that stuff.

## Install

`[sudo] python setup.py install`

## Usage

`rlb --path path-to-store --project-name name-for-project`

- This would be used for a javascript react project

`rlb --path path-to-store --project-name name-for-project --typescript`

- This would be used for a typescript react project
